* It’s an important mechanism in Business Intelligence to identify potential problem areas of a process.
* For example, it’s used to observe the revenue or loss in a sales process for each stage. 
* A funnel chart has multiple phases and values associated with them.
* Here is a table that represents a user flow funnel for a app.
* The column named 'Values' represents the total number of users at that Phase.
